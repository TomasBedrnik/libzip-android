libzip for Android
==================
This is a repackaging of [libzip](https://nih.at/libzip) for the Android NDK, using *ndk-build* to build.

Source files added: `config.h`, `zipconfig.h`.

Build files added:  `Android.mk`, `Application.mk`, and (for convenience and/or example usage) `build.sh`

The 'master' branch of this repository contains version **1.1.2** of libzip. 


libzip has been written by Dieter Baron and Thomas Klausner ()
The original repackaging was done by Julien Rebetez (https://github.com/julienr/libzip-android)
