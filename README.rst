libzip for Android
==================
This is a repackaging of libzip for the Android NDK, using *ndk-build* to build.

Source files added: *config.h*, *zipconfig.h*.

Build files added:  *Android.mk*, *Application.mk*, and (for convenience and/or example usage) *build.sh*

The 'master' branch of this repository contains version **1.5.1** of libzip. Windows specific and crypto parts of library removed. **This version is not tested on Android yet.**

libzip has been written by Dieter Baron and Thomas Klausner (https://nih.at/libzip)

The original repackaging was done by Julien Rebetez (https://github.com/julienr/libzip-android)
